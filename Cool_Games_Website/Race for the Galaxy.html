            “In Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by game cards that
            represent worlds or technical and social developments.
            <br>
            Each turn each player chooses one action, but the others will share in the actions
            chosen, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different
            action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these
            phases, every player performs the phase’s action, while the selecting player(s)
            also get a bonus for that phase.”
