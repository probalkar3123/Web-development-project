        <br>
        “The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the
        end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players
        compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3 -5
        boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each
        player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and
        prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed those who do not take care of
        the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most
        prestige at the end is the winner.”
