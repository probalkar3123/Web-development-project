        <h3><b>Power Grid:</b></h3>
        <br>
        “Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game
        Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original
        edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil
        Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
        The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when
        someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark
        pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other
        to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.
        However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become
        available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to
        superior equipment.
        <br>
        Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and
        uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar
        plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your
        plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly
        expand your network to get the cheapest routes.”
